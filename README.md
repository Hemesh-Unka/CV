After four years of taming the seven seas as 2nd Officer in the oil and gas industry, I decided that the time was right to shake off the sea legs and pursue a career towards something I have been always truly passionate about.

As a recent graduate from Makers Academy, I'm currently looking for a career in London as a **full-stack developer** with an ambitious company working at the top of their field. Working on a product that I can get excited about is crucial, as is working in a team that will support me in learning new skills.

**Tech Skills:** TDD, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Git Workflow

## Projects

| GitHub Repo | Description | Code/Demo Links | Tech Stack |
| :---------: | --------- | :---------: | --------- |
| [DrSerpent]([7]) | Teamed up with 4 technical individuals to create a testing framework that was tested within itself and built in a language that we had no prior experience with. It's on open source and crazily enough people are even downloading it! | [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12001682/39885119-bbc0574c-5483-11e8-8233-93e876e62802.png)]([8]) | Python, DrSerpent |
| [Acebook-Pinkfish]([5]) | Working in team of 5 to create a social media platform over a 2 week period. As a team, we learnt a lot about collaborating with git, as well as delegation between us, regular stand-ups, and working with XP values and agile practices. | [![heroku-48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12953472/18688266/701982fc-7f7b-11e6-8971-5f1e03f554b7.png)][6] | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Paperclip, Devise, Heroku, Spectre |
| [BlahBlah]([3]) | A test driven, lightweight twitter clone built in ruby. This was a project that made me realise how far I had come in terms of object orientated programming and test driven development. | [![aws](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12001682/39510305-3107040a-4de1-11e8-8adf-202174f66428.png)][4] | Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, PostgreSQL, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Spectre  |
| [Waylo]([1]) | Personal project: A beer/cider price tracker for a popular New Zealand supermarket chain. Scraper and website were built with no prior knowledge of JS code or test driven development! | [![heroku-48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12953472/18688266/701982fc-7f7b-11e6-8971-5f1e03f554b7.png)][2] | JavaScript, Backbone.js, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap

## Skills

**Problem Solving**



Break down a problem. Wether it is a hideous stack trace error from a program, to how to break down the deck of a vessel for a full of cargo.
Perseverance

**Leadership**
Whilst at sea, I was required to lead a number of different teams in a variety of situations.

From shipboard drills to critical field operations, I always lead by example no matter what task is at hand.

**Quick Learner**
For the

- Whilst at sea I was always leading a variety of different teams.
- During makers I always felt like I contributed to a number of projects. Taking the lead on the acebook backround highlighted
At sea I always was required to manage a variety of different teams. At times I was directly responsible for their safety during critical operations.

**Communication and Honesty**
I believe that the ability for a developer what their code does to others is crucial. Wether it be easy to read code, or

**Team player** - I believe that the success of the team depends on the commitment of its members. My ability to work effectively in demanding situations, allow me to thrive in a team environment or as an individual if need arises.

At Makers I would regularly stay late and help others if they required any assistance with their code. I always enjoyed this part of the day as I would always learn

During my time at Makers, I have usually stayed till closing time. What I noticed that fellow students came up to me for assistance if they were struggling on some code. What I liked to do was break down the code into smaller bite sized chunks allowing them to understand and explain witch ech piece of code does.

**Challenge orientated & analytical thinker** - During my time at MMA Offshore, in addition to my normal work schedule, I would regularly seek out additional tasks to take on. One instance was to develop checklists for vessel specific equipment. These checklists would later become a valuable tool on not only my vessel, but amongst several vessels in the fleet.
