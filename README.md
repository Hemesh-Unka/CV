A motivated, enthusiastic **Junior Full Stack Developer** aspiring to take on a career in the tech scene of London.

Over the past four years, I was working in the oil and gas industry as a 2nd Officer. During this time I was more inclined, curious and passionate towards the tech aspect of the job and this is what particularly drew me towards becoming a developer.

Since February 2018, I have been studying at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), one of Europe's leading developer bootcamps, where I have been learning the fundamentals of software development. My current experience at Makers Academy has highlighted the importance of best coding practices, and this is something I want to build upon and one of my biggest priorities in looking for a Junior Developer role.

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, RSpec, Git, GitHub, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB
