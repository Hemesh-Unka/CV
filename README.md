After four years of taming the seven seas as 2nd Officer in the oil and gas industry, I decided that the time was right to shake off the sea legs and pursue a career towards something I have been always truly passionate about.

As a recent graduate from Makers Academy, I'm currently looking for a career in London as a **full-stack developer** with an ambitious company working at the top of their field. Working on a product that I can get excited about is crucial, as is working in a team that will support me in learning new skills.

**Tech Skills:** TDD, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Git Workflow

## Projects

| GitHub Repo | Description | Code/Demo Links | Tech Stack |
| :---------: | --------- | :---------: | --------- |
| [DrSerpent][7] | Teamed up with 4 technical individuals to create a testing framework that was tested within itself and built in a language that we had no prior experience with. It's on open source and crazily enough people are even downloading it! | [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12001682/39885119-bbc0574c-5483-11e8-8233-93e876e62802.png)][8] | Python, DrSerpent |
| [Acebook-Pinkfish][5] | Working in team of 5 to create a social media platform over a 2 week period. As a team, we learnt a lot about collaborating with git, as well as delegation between us, regular stand-ups, and working with XP values and agile practices. | [![heroku-48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12953472/18688266/701982fc-7f7b-11e6-8971-5f1e03f554b7.png)][6] | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Paperclip, Devise, Heroku, Spectre |
| [BlahBlah][3] | A test driven, lightweight twitter clone built in ruby. This was a project that made me realise how far I had come in terms of object orientated programming and test driven development. | [![aws](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12001682/39510305-3107040a-4de1-11e8-8adf-202174f66428.png)][4] | Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, PostgreSQL, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Spectre  |
| [Waylo][1] | Personal project: A beer/cider price tracker for a popular New Zealand supermarket chain. Scraper and website were built with no prior knowledge of JS code or test driven development! | [![heroku-48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12953472/18688266/701982fc-7f7b-11e6-8971-5f1e03f554b7.png)][2] | JavaScript, Backbone.js, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap
