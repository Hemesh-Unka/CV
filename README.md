After four years of taming the seven seas as 2nd Officer in the oil and gas industry, I decided that the time was right to shake off the sea legs and pursue a career towards something I have been always truly passionate about.

As a recent graduate from Makers Academy , I'm currently looking for a career in London as a **full-stack** developer with an ambitious company working at the top of their field. Working on a product that I can get excited about is crucial, as is working in a team that will support me in learning new skills.

**Tech Skills:** TDD, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Git Workflow

## Projects

| GitHub Repo | Description | Code/Demo Links | Tech Stack |
| :---------: | --------- | :---------: | --------- |
| [DrSerpent][7] | Teamed up with 4 technical individuals over a 2 week timeframe to create a testing framework from scratch. Our goal was to have its code tested within itself and built in a language that we had no prior experience with. It's now on open source and people are even downloading it! | [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12001682/39885119-bbc0574c-5483-11e8-8233-93e876e62802.png)]([8]) | Python, DrSerpent |
| [Acebook-Pinkfish][5] | Working in team of 5 to create a social media platform over a 2 week period. As a team, we learnt a lot about collaborating with git, as well as delegation between us, regular stand-ups, and working with XP values and agile practices. | [![heroku-48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12953472/18688266/701982fc-7f7b-11e6-8971-5f1e03f554b7.png)][6] | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Paperclip, Devise, Heroku, Spectre |
| [BlahBlah][3] | A test driven, lightweight twitter clone built in ruby. This was a project that made me realise how far I had come in terms of object orientated programming and test driven development. | [![aws](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12001682/39510305-3107040a-4de1-11e8-8adf-202174f66428.png)][4] | Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, PostgreSQL, AWS, Spectre  |
| [Waylo][1]) | Personal project: A beer/cider price tracker for a popular New Zealand supermarket chain. Scraper and website were built with no prior knowledge of JavaScript or test driven development! | [![heroku-48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12953472/18688266/701982fc-7f7b-11e6-8971-5f1e03f554b7.png)][2] | JavaScript, Backbone.js, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap

## Skills

**Problem Solving**

I have always prided myself on my ability to solve a problem. Whether it is a nasty stack trace message, to troubleshooting multiple failures with navigational equipment onboard a vessel. I have always enjoyed breaking down a problem, finding the root cause and learning from specific outcomes from doing such an exercise.

For example, we had an issue with the deployment pipeline in our **Acebook-Pinkfish** project. We needed to feature test some JavaScript code, and Travis CI does not allow in-browser testing. After doing some research on the topic, I came across a solution which utilised Google Chrome's headless browser within Travis. This small problem opened me up to the world of headless browsers and drivers that were compatible with Selenium. It also allowed me to get a good feel for tradeoffs between different drivers out in the wild and how they interacted with Travis CI.

**Leadership**

Whilst at sea, I was required to lead a number of different teams in a variety of situations. From shipboard drills to critical field operations, I strive to be transparent whilst keeping a down to earth approach to any situation.

For instance, during a shift at sea, we experienced an issue with the hose joint that connects the ship to the oil rig. As a 2nd Officer, I was commanded by the captain to go down and speak with the deck crew and instruct them how to resolve the issue. Once on deck, I directed the crew to get some rags so that they could stop the air leak from the connection.
My leadership skills helped my team to avoid bodily harm while it also prevented the oil rig from encountering delays in its drilling operations.

**Team player**

I believe that the success of the team depends on the commitment of its members. I always like to go above and beyond to make sure that my team members are fully on board so we can work more effectively in order to achieve our goals faster.

During my time at Makers Academy, I've spent a lot of time pair programming. The feedback I get after these pairing sessions were always positive and people were happy to approach me again with further questions or advice. When working on various team projects, I came across as a reliable and efficient team member. I have always been willing to stay till closing time to work on my side projects, and I noticed that fellow students approached me for assistance if they were struggling on with a piece of code. It was a great opportunity to work on my communication and coaching skills and grow as a developer.
